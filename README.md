deprecated in 1999 but, it is still user to refer for related technologies.</b>
SSL and TLS are protocols to make secure (authenticated and encrypted) connection between network nodes. Current TLS
version is [1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446) and standard port is 443.

## General Concepts

### Entity

Entity means a client in server/client relation that needs to interact over a secure channel, such as websites,
companies, individual persons.

### Certificate authority (CA)

### Public/Private Key

The pair key is generated by service owner (Server). Private key must be in a safe place and, it does not share with the
other entities and public key is a part should be shared with other entities.</b>
Data are encrypted by public key and decrypt with private key.

### Certificate

Certificate is digital document that use for binding the identity of an entity to pair keys. SSL certificates are a type
of X.509 Certificate (X.509 is a standard format for public key certificates).

### Certificate signing Request

### Chain of Trust

### Trust Anchor

### Intermediate Certificate

### PKI
